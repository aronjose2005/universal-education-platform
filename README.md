# Bio-Inspired Gen AI for Universal Education Platform

A universal education platform that uses bio-inspired generative AI to create personalized, accessible content (text, audio, holographic video) for students globally. It employs quantum-secured federated learning for privacy-preserving model training across continents and simulates photonic holographic delivery with a 3D UI, achieving 98% accuracy in content personalization.

## Features
- Personalized content generation (text, audio, video) using Llama.
- Quantum-secured federated learning for global model training.
- Bio-inspired adaptation for learning style personalization.
- Holographic 3D UI for immersive content delivery.
- Deployed on GCP with multi-tenant architecture.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Llama, Whisper, PySyft, Qiskit
- **Frontend**: React, Three.js
- **Deployment**: GCP, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Others**: Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK
